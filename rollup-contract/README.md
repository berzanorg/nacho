# nacho-rollup-contract

The rollup smart contract of [Nacho](https://github.com/berzanorg/nacho) built using [o1js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/o1js).

[`nacho-rollup-contract`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nacho-rollup-contract) package is intended to be used for [Nacho](https://github.com/berzanorg/nacho) only as it is a naive implementation.

## üîç Details

Nacho's rollup contract extends o1js's `SmartContract` by overriding existing `init` method and adding a new method called `settle`.
The method `init` is overridden to initialize the state of the contract as empty root hashes of Merkle trees that hold the rollup's state.

### üõ†Ô∏è Smart Contract Methods

-   [`settle(zkProof)`](https://github.com/berzanorg/nacho/blob/main/rollup-contractr/src/rollup-contract.ts#L15):

    Takes a [`ZkProof`](https://github.com/berzanorg/nacho/blob/main/proof-generator/src/zk-proof.ts) as the only parameter and checks if its public input is equal to the settled one, then updates the contract's state accordingly.
